# {{.PackName}}

This pack is a simple Nomad job that runs as a service and can be accessed via
HTTP.

## Changing the Message

To change the message this server responds with, change the "message" variable
when running the pack.

```
nomad-pack run {{.PackName}} --var message="Hola Mundo!"
```

This tells Nomad Pack to tweak the `MESSAGE` environment variable that the
service reads from.

## Consul Service and Load Balancer Integration

Optionally, it can configure a Consul service.

If the `register_consul_service` is unset or set to true, the Consul service
will be registered.

Several load balancers in the the [Nomad Pack Community Registry][pack-registry]
are configured to connect to this service by default.

The [NGINX][pack-nginx] and [HAProxy][pack-haproxy] packs are configured to
balance the Consul service `{{.PackName}}-service`, which is the default value
for the `consul_service_name` variable.

The [Fabio][pack-fabio] and [Traefik][pack-traefik] packs are configured to
search for Consul services with the tags found in the default value of the
`consul_service_tags` variable.
